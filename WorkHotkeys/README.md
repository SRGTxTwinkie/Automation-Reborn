# Keyboard-Interface
An interface for the Python Keyboard Library that provides more control over keypresses. 


## Why I made it 
I absolutley love the Python Keyboard Library, it is by far one of my favorite libraries I have ever used.
It is so useful for everything I do, and has so many nice features, but I wanted more control over everything.
While incredibly simple, these functions do everything I wish was inside the library.

## Also included is a very simple config file reader/writer
There are better ones out there, and probably ones that are easier to use, but I wanted to make one, so I did.
I plan on using it for universal keybinds throughout the files I use.
